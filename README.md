# Stay FocuSD

**Stay FocuSD** is a cross-platform productivity and study companion desktop app. It combines a **Pomodoro Timer** with **AI-powered attention tracking** to help you stay focused, analyze your study habits, and build better concentration over time.

The app uses a custom [Machine Learning backend](https://github.com/BrandonGarate177/FocuSD_Lamp) to detect when you're paying attention. So you can stay FocuSD, not just busy.

  Every session logs your focused and distracted moments, which are then analyzed for patterns.

  A dynamic UI notifies you in real time if your attention slips, and suggests when to take breaks.

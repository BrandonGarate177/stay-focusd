# Stay FocuSD

**Stay FocuSD** is a cross-platform productivity and study companion desktop app. It combines a **Pomodoro Timer** with **AI-powered attention tracking** to help you stay focused, analyze your study habits, and build better concentration over time.

The app uses a custom [Machine Learning backend](https://github.com/BrandonGarate177/FocuSD_Lamp) to detect when you're paying attention. So you can stay FocuSD, not just busy.

## How It Works

- **Attention Detection**  
  Your webcam feed is analyzed using a [custom ML backend](https://github.com/BrandonGarate177/FocuSD_Lamp) to determine if you're paying attention.

- **Session Tracking**  
  Every session logs your focused and distracted moments, which are then analyzed for patterns.

- **Live Feedback & Alerts**  
  A dynamic UI notifies you in real time if your attention slips, and suggests when to take breaks.

- **Data Storage**  
  All focus sessions are stored locally. You can customize where data is saved for better control and privacy.
